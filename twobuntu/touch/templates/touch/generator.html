            <h2>Ubuntu Touch Device Art Generator</h2>
            <p>
                You've just finished writing an Ubuntu Touch app and you're ready to start distributing it through the Ubuntu Store.
                How do you begin promoting your app? How can you show visitors to your blog what your app actually looks like on a device?
            </p>
            <p>
                We've got you covered!
            </p>
            <p>
                Upload a screenshot of your app and click the generate button below.
                Our server will generate a picture of your app running on an actual Ubuntu phone for you to use wherever you'd like.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> as a general rule of thumb, the height of the screenshot should be at least twice the width.
                Our tool will automatically perform any rescaling and cropping.
